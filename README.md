# Almost Compose Game

## Goal
#### The goal is to develop a sample Compose application that enables me to explore new Compose-related technologies and engage in experimental work with various libraries.

## App Topic
#### The app topic is a Card Game. Why game? Because it's more difficult and it's unusual type of app for a pure Android application in Kotlin. And I'm just fond of computer and mobile games.

## Architecture
#### The architecture is weakly expressed, since I focused more on the UI part, however, there are attempts to use Clean Architecture implementing MVVM and embryos of MVI.
